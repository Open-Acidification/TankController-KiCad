# TankController-KiCad

The [Tank Controller](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/TankController) project utilizes a half-shield for an Arduino Mega. This repo holds the PCB specification used to create the half-shield.

## Software Requirements

1. [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) - The PCB layout was created with KiCad which works on multiple platforms.

## Viewing and Editing the PCB

1. Clone this repo to your local computer.
1. Open KiCad.
1. Use the KiCad menu to open the `Half_Shield.pro` project file.
    * _File -> Open Project_
    * Navigate to your local repo location and select `Half_Shield.pro` project file.
1. View the PCB.

## Release

Each release has the appropriate binary Gerber (`.gbr`) and Drill (`.drl`) to be sent to the PCB board printing company.

We may have extra printed. Please [contact us](https://gab.wallawalla.edu/~kirt.onthank/) for details.

## Notes

* The current release was made a while ago and a new version of KiCad is now available. When you open the project, the software will ask to update the project.
